                    <p> Hi! My name is Aisha (phonetic spelling: ay-zhuh).
                       I am a junior full-stack software developer pursuing my passion in coding, reigniting the days of my youth
                        where I'd make front-end websites of my favorite cartoon/video game characters in the early and late 2000s.
                         I am a highly focused problem solver with excellent research and troubleshooting skills, committed to
                         breaking into the tech industry.</p>

                    <p> I am a full stack developer currently located in Columbus, OH. My love for learning,and taking on challenging task has set me on the path of coding. I love to see projects come "alive". I am a dedicated team
                    player, but I also work well on my own. Outside of development I enjoy researching anything that catches
                    my attention from music,dance, how the mind works etc.. Most importantly I love spending time with my family!</p>

                    <p>Zachary Martin is a Columbus-based full-stack software developer with a passion for travel, the outdoors,
                       gardening, and technology. His passion for technology started very early, when he took an interest in
                       gaming. In his early 20's, he built his first gaming pc, and computers for his father's law practice.
                       From there, his interest in hardware and software design grew. Though his passion was in technology,
                       it was his love for the outdoors and interest in life science that drove his to pursue a Bachelors degree
                       in Biology at Ohio University, which he completed in 2009. After years of working in healthcare, Zach
                       decided he wanted to turn his interest in technology into a career, and to leave his career in healthcare
                       behind! Zach is enthusiastic about growing and gaining new skills as a software developer and is
                       looking forward to a future in the field of IT!</p>
