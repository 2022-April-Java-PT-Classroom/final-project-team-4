                    <p> Hi! My name is Aisha (phonetic spelling: ay-zhuh).
                       I am a junior full-stack software developer pursuing my passion in coding, reigniting the days of my youth
                        where I'd make front-end websites of my favorite cartoon/video game characters in the early and late 2000s.
                         I am a highly focused problem solver with excellent research and troubleshooting skills, committed to
                         breaking into the tech industry.</p>

                    <p> I am a full stack developer currently located in Columbus, OH. My love for learning,and taking on challenging task has set me on the path of coding. I love to see projects come "alive". I am a dedicated team
                    player, but I also work well on my own. Outside of development I enjoy researching anything that catches
                    my attention from music,dance, how the mind works etc.. Most importantly I love spending time with my family!</p>

                    <p>Zachary Martin is a Columbus-based full-stack software developer with a passion for travel, the
                    outdoors, gardening, and technology. His passion for technology started very early, when he took an
                    interest in gaming and computers. From there, his interest in hardware and software design grew.
                    Though his passion was in technology, it was his love for the outdoors and interest in life science
                    that drove him to pursue a Bachelors degree in Biology at Ohio University, which he completed in
                    2009. Zach is enthusiastic about growing and gaining new skills as a software developer and is
                    looking forward to a future in the field of IT!</p>
